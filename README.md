# Squad-Combat-Initiative
A Foundry VTT module for enhanced group-based initiative management.
Group combatants into visual headers, auto-roll shared initiative, and streamline large-scale combat!

Do you love throwing hordes of enemies at your players but hate the hassle of managing their initiative?
Tired of manually averaging initiative rolls?
This module lets you group actors together under clean visual headers with minimal fuss.

🎯 Features
👥 Create initiative groups directly in the combat tracker

Either create a group and drag actors into it

Or select multiple actors and click “Add Group”
