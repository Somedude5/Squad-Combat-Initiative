# Squad-Combat-Initiative
A Foundry VTT module for enhanced group-based initiative management.

Do you love throwing hordes of enemies at your players but hate the hassle of managing their initiative?
Tired of manually averaging initiative rolls?
This module lets you group actors together under clean visual headers with minimal fuss.

🎯 Features
