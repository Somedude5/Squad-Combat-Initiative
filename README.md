# Squad-Combat-Initiative
A Foundry VTT module for enhanced group-based initiative management in the Dnd 5e system.

Group combatants into visual headers, auto-roll shared initiative, and streamline large-scale combat!

Do you love throwing hordes of enemies at your players but hate the hassle of managing their initiative?
Tired of manually averaging initiative rolls?
This module lets you group actors together under clean visual headers with minimal fuss.

🎯 Features
